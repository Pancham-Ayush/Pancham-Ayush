# 💫 About Me:
I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in Java and Spring Boot, experienced in building scalable backend systems using microservice architecture. I design cloud-native systems with service discovery, API gateways, and inter-service communication, and I integrate AI-powered features using Spring AI (RAG pipelines, vector embeddings, LLM orchestration).

I enjoy building production-grade systems deployed on AWS/GCP with observability, caching, and messaging. I have solved 180+ LeetCode problems, demonstrating strong problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. I am an active member of the Java User Group (JUG) and a contributor to the GDG Cloud community, where I engage in cloud-native development, technical discussions, and peer learning.

## 🔭 Currently Working On
- Building Spring AI-powered microservices with RAG and vector databases  
- Designing a production-grade API Gateway + Service Discovery setup  
- Improving system observability (metrics, tracing, logging)
